# Objective
Our objective is to build an application platform which acts as an intermediary between pet owners and pet service providers. The platform will essentially be an “Airbnb for pets” where pet owners can temporarily leave their pets in the care of verified pet service providers. The platform will contain features that facilitate the interactions between the two parties during the pet owner’s search for a pet service provider, the duration of the pet’s stay, and the pet’s departure.

# Key Personas
We will have two key personas reflecting the archetypal users of our application platform:
### 1. Pet owners who are busy and need someone to take care of their pet while they are gone.
*e.g. Chelsea: a 25-year old supply chain manager, who works for a popular startup company. She is the owner of a three year old German Shepherd and some other animals. Due to the nature of her job, she often travels for weeks at a time.*

### 2. Homeowners who have space in their homes and experience with animals and are looking to make money.
*e.g. Matt: a 21-year old University of Toronto student who grew up with a lot of pets. He is looking to offer his pet handling services during his free time to make some extra money.*

# Usage Scenario
Chelsea received a call from her boss requesting her to immediately fly to San Francisco. According to her boss, their company needs her to meet up with some suppliers to secure a business deal. Chelsea estimates that her trip will take at least a week. Unfortunately, none of her friends are free in the coming week to take care of Xavier, her three year old German Shepherd. Xavier has a lot of energy and requires very specific handling. Chelsea wants to find a pet service provider near her home with whom she can leave Xavier with for the next week.

# Key Principles
### Platform should be convenient to use for pet owners:
The platform should be designed so that pet owners should not have to spend a lot of time to figure out how everything works. The process of finding a pet service provider, contacting them, and booking their service should be intuitive and have a high degree of convenience.

### Platform should be customizable for pet service providers:
The platform should allow pet service providers to customize their services. For example, they should be able to change their pricing, pet types allowed, services provided, etc.
