# General Information

Our 7-persons team intends to create a mobile application for Pawsup, a pet service provider. We have a repository on GitHub and we track our work using Jira. Our team is organized into two main groups, a 4 person front-end group and a 3 person back-end group; we may also divide these groups further depending on the task. The tasks and whoever is responsible for these tasks are generally listed in a google document for convenience. Our weekly meetings include reviewing everyone’s tasks, taking questions, identifying areas that are lagging behind, and finding solutions to bring these areas up to speed.

# Communication

To communicate between and within groups, we have a discord server where we host weekly team meetings on Friday, and more frequent meetings within smaller groups of people (which will be dynamically decided at every meeting). Currently, we plan on having around 3 small group meetings per week.

In our weekly meetings, in addition to reviewing everyone’s tasks, we go over project requirements, debate about implementation methods, and split the work as evenly as we can. More specifically, we generally have 1 person leading the conversation by sharing their screen, reviewing the details of the meeting with everyone, and typing it into a meeting document (which will contain the results of our meeting). Other members will typically chime in with their ideas throughout the meeting, and this is when we debate about everyone’s ideas. Towards the end of the meeting, we will split the work amongst ourselves as evenly as possible, and we will decide on the next meeting time.

In our small group meeting, we may discuss specific implementation details, provide assistance to other members, and engage in peer programming.


# Decision Making

Our team’s decision-making process is primarily debating, as we have no central leader that decides the final outcome. As mentioned before, members will present their ideas to the group, and the idea will be evaluated by the entire team. If the team accepts the idea, then we will include it in our meeting document.

# Defining Points of User Stories

During our weekly meeting, we used planning poker to decide the point values of each user story. For each user story, we briefly discussed the things we need to do for it and everybody rated it's workload/difficulty using our rating system. The lowest and highest values explained their reasoning for their scores, and then we usually settled on a score in between by debating about the scores and repeating this process. Discrepancies in our ratings were usually due to a lack of understanding as to knowing exactly what to do for some user stories. In this case, we usually rate the story slightly higher to compensate for uncertainty.

Our point values is based off of the Modified Fibonacci Sequence point system.
