# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting:
The sprint 1 planning meeting was held using discord and all team members attended. In our meeting we discussed our plan for sprint 1 including what features we are prioritizing as well as the responsibilities of each group member. We selected user stories to complete and broke them down into tasks which were assigned to group members. We decided that for sprint 1 we want to focus on the core elements of our web application such as user accounts, services, and backend APIs.

# Spike 
Both the front-end and back-end teams encountered spikes throughout this sprint. Members of the frontend team had to learn React as well as Bootstrap. Members of the backend team had to familiarize themselves with the MVC structure and Node modules such as Express and Passport.

# Unfinished Work
NODE-34 is unfinished because the assignee has assignments due in other courses and took a long time to learn the necessities to get started. Thus, having finished NODE-32 and NODE-33 there was no extra time left for the assignee.
