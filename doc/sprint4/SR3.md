# Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 3
- Gary: I really enjoyed the opportunity to do full stack development for the cart system, as I had mainly been working on the backend for my other tasks
- Ivan: As I get more experience working with React Bootstrap, working on this project became easier and more enjoyable, allowing me to complete more tasks in a shorter amount of time
- Jonathan: I enjoyed the experience working in a full stack env and learning everything about react and connecting apis.
- Tyler: Weighing the cost / benefits of all the potential payment options was fascinating and I learned a lot about payment gateways and encryption.
- Meng: Backend members were really helpful when I was connecting frontend to backend.
