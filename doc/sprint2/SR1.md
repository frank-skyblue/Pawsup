# Sprint 1 Retrospective
# Participants
- Gary Xie
- Chongmin Bai
- Mengqi Zhao
- Jesse Zhang
- Frank Kong
- Ivan Shao
- Tyler Reichert

# Unfinished Tasks
- NODE-34 is unfinished because the assignee has assignments due in other courses and took a long time to learn the necessities to get started.

# Practices to Continue Next Sprint
- Jonathan: Communicate between Team members.
- Gary: Organized planning of tasks to work on for the sprint
- Tyler: Well organized standups
- Ivan: Organized standups, efficient team work
- Jonathan: Branch Name and Commit Messages need to be consistent and follow the rules.
- Jonathan: Everyone needs to update CRC cards, Software Architecture Diagram, and Documentation google driver files before the end of our sprint. 

# New Practices to Start Using Next Sprint
- Tyler: More communication between back-end team members
- Tyler: Start working on documentation and rubric from the first meeting.
- Jonathan: Start documenting our jira ticket.
- Frank: More communication between front-end and back-end (maybe even have a channel for connecting front-end and back-end)
- Ivan: More communication between front-end and back-end.
- Jesse: Having a list of things to go over during sprint meetings might be helpful.

# Harmful Practices to Stop Using Next Sprint
- Gary: Stop procrastinating on tasks and start them earlier, so that there is less pressure at the end of the sprint.

# Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 1
- Ivan: A lot of learning(React, Bootstrap, Axios, JS...) was necessary before I can start working on creating web pages
- Tyler: It took 20 hours of watching node videos before I started being useful.
- Jesse: Took a long time of googling things to understand how the code works.
- Frank: Learning to use the tools like Git and Jira efficiently takes time.
- Meng: Too much self-learning of React.js, CSS and HTML to get started.
