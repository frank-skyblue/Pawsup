# The goal for sprint 2:
Set up as much of the frontend and backend for all the pages, tasks that couldnâ€™t finish in sprint2 will be pushed to sprint3. By sprint 3 all frontend and backend should be done. Sprint4 will be working on connecting these together.

# Spike
There were some difficulties in creating a sort and filter bar in terms of aligning the visuals and implementing the functionalities, also some spikes were present in attempting to get and display items from the backend.

# Unfinished Work
- The Account page for the admins (low priority, will consider in sprint 3)
- Connecting front-end to back-end for Sign-up page, Service page, and Product page (will do so in sprint 3)
- CreateService page front end (will be done in sprint 3)
