# The Pawsup App

## My contributions
This is a full-stack web application I co-developed with 6 other people.

My primary responsibility is on the front-end of the application, where I used **React** to build the [product page](client/src/components/FeaturedProducts.js) and the [filter](client/src/components/ServiceFilter.js).

We utilized the [AGILE](https://agilemanifesto.org/) methodology in our developmental process, to see this process, please visit the [documentation folder](doc/).

## Project Description

- This project aims to create a mobile version of the [Pawsup](https://pawsupinc.com/) application which provides services including selling pet products, homestays for pets(similar to airbnb), posting pet pictures on their social media platform, and more.
- This project will be developed as a web application first then be made compatible with mobile through PWA(Progress Web Apps).
